# Reinforcejs: Reinforcement learning for C++

<!-- Bades: travis build, github version, github release date, last commit date, codeclimate maintainability, codeclimate test coverage -->

## Description

This project is based on [reinforcejs](https://github.com/karpathy/reinforcejs)
and seen as a port to C++, with several code improvements.

It inherits the limitations of the original project.

Planned features:

- [ ] multithreading support
- [ ] automatic use of SIMD commands

## Installation

For source code installation:

`./configure && make`

To install, just run `make install`

Tests are included under `make test` and style checks under `make check-style`

There will might be binaries available, but that will be decided on a later
point.

## Examples

```c++
